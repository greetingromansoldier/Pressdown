Here's the deal, I'm done with Windows. For years, I told myself it was "good enough," but I've come to realize that using it is like trying to run a marathon with a pebble in my shoe.

## Rational Reasons I hate it now

You can spend years learning all the workarounds and registry hacks,
but you'll still be fighting the system. 

- **Forced Updates at the Worst Times** - do you like stability in production? Well, _officialy_ described side effects include DEATH OF THE SYSTEM because of _some_ updates. 
- The Bloatware Epidemic: Why does a fresh install of a "professional" operating system come with Candy Crush and TikTok? 
- **UI Inconsistency**: It's a Frankenstein's monster of design. You do not have just a _Windows 11_, you better learn everything Windows once was.
- **Catastrophic performance**: Try fast tapping your "win" key constantly opening the Start Menu and see this small intricate CPU rising into the stratosphere.


## My Least Favorite "Features" (in order)

1. **Cortana**: The ghost of a "helpful" assistant that nobody asked for and nobody uses.
2. **The Microsoft Store**: A barren wasteland of apps that somehow manages to be slower than a web browser.
3. **File Explorer Ads**: The day I saw a "recommendation" for a Microsoft product in my file explorer was the day I knew I had to leave.
4. The Registry: A terrifying, arcane database where one wrong move can send your entire system into oblivion. And believe me you DON'T know what a move it will be...

Here's how _normal_ people update their `software` on a _normal_ system:

```
# Update all my software? Okay.
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
